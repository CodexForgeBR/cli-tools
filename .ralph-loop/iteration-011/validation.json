{"RALPH_VALIDATION": {"verdict": "NEEDS_MORE_WORK", "feedback": "Iteration 11 implementer did ZERO work \u2014 'Prompt is too long' error again, 0 tokens produced. This is the SAME failure mode as iterations 2, 3, 7-10. The loop is stuck because the implementation prompt exceeds the context window.\n\n7 TASKS REMAIN INCOMPLETE (same as iteration 10 \u2014 no progress):\n\n1. T081: Help text test in internal/cli/usage_test.go only checks substring presence (assert.Contains for flag names). Task requires CHARACTER-FOR-CHARACTER comparison against shell version's --help output. Current test is insufficient.\n\n2. T125: Run golangci-lint and fix all lint issues. golangci-lint is NOT INSTALLED on this machine. Install with `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest` then run `golangci-lint run ./...` and fix all issues.\n\n3. T126: Diff `ralph-loop --help` against `ralph-loop.sh --help`. No diff was ever performed. Build the Go binary, run both help commands, and diff the output. Fix discrepancies.\n\n4. T127: Create a state file with the shell version, load it with Go binary, save back, and diff. No evidence this was done. The testdata state files are Go-native fixtures, not shell-generated.\n\n5. T128: Diff each .txt template against corresponding shell prompt file. No formal diff performed. CRITICAL: cross-validation.txt (22 lines vs shell's 160), tasks-validation.txt (15 lines vs shell's 122), and final-plan.txt (20 lines vs shell's 60) are SIGNIFICANTLY TRUNCATED. Missing detailed rules, examples, output formats.\n\n6. T129: Test each exit condition (0-6, 130) produces same code as shell version. No evidence of verification.\n\n7. T132: Run goreleaser check. goreleaser is NOT INSTALLED. Install with `go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@latest` then run `goreleaser check`.\n\nALSO: T130 requires coverprofile output but coverage.out was never generated. And ALL 132 tasks in tasks.md are still marked [ ] unchecked \u2014 mark completed tasks as [x].\n\nNOTE TO ORCHESTRATOR: The implementer has hit 'Prompt is too long' for 6+ consecutive iterations. The remaining 7 tasks are all small verification/polish tasks that do NOT require reading the full codebase. The orchestrator MUST intervene by drastically reducing the implementation prompt \u2014 include ONLY the 7 specific task descriptions (T081, T125-T132), not the full tasks.md, not the spec, not the plan.
