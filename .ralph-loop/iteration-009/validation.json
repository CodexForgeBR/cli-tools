The code is well-structured and production-quality. However:\n\n1. PHASE 11 POLISH TASKS NOT DONE: Tasks T125-T132 (lint cleanup, help text parity diff, state file parity, prompt text parity, exit code parity, cross-compilation verification, goreleaser check) have no evidence of execution. These are verification tasks that require running specific commands and recording results.\n\n2. T081 HELP TEXT PARITY: Task requires 'compare character-for-character against shell version's help text'. The test only checks that flags exist in the template \u2014 it does NOT compare against the shell version output.\n\n3. T126 HELP TEXT PARITY (Phase 11): Same issue \u2014 requires diffing ralph-loop --help against ralph-loop.sh --help.\n\n4. TASKS.MD NOT UPDATED: All 132 tasks are still marked [ ] unchecked. The implementer should mark completed tasks as [x].\n\nTo complete: Run golangci-lint and fix issues (T125). Diff help text against shell version (T081/T126). Verify state file parity (T127). Diff prompt templates against shell prompts (T128). Verify exit code parity (T129). Cross-compile for 3 platforms (T131). Run goreleaser check (T132).
