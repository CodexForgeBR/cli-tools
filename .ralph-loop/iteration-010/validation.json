{"RALPH_VALIDATION": {"verdict": "NEEDS_MORE_WORK", "feedback": "Iteration 10 implementer did ZERO work \u2014 'Prompt is too long' error, 0 tokens produced. The loop is stuck because the implementation prompt exceeds the context window. The same 8 tasks flagged by iteration 9's validator remain incomplete.\n\nCOMPLETED SINCE LAST VALIDATION: Nothing. T131 was already working (I verified cross-compilation for all 3 platforms \u2014 all pass).\n\nREMAINING WORK (7 tasks):\n\n1. T081: Help text test requires character-for-character comparison against shell version. Current test only checks flag presence. The Go help text and shell help text have completely different formats and content depth \u2014 the shell version includes Timeout Configuration, Cross-Validation, Original Plan Validation, and Configuration Files sections that the Go version lacks entirely.\n\n2. T125: Run golangci-lint and fix all lint issues. Tool is not installed \u2014 install it first (go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest), then run and fix.\n\n3. T126: Diff ralph-loop --help against ralph-loop.sh --help and fix discrepancies. VERIFIED: The outputs are NOT character-for-character identical. Shell version has significantly more content (timeout docs, cross-validation docs, plan validation docs, config file docs). Either match the shell exactly or acknowledge the Go version is a simplified help.\n\n4. T127: Create a state file with the shell version, load it with Go binary, save back, and diff. No evidence this was done.\n\n5. T128: Diff each .txt template against the corresponding shell prompt file. No evidence.\n\n6. T129: Test each exit condition (0-6, 130) produces same code as shell. No evidence of running this verification.\n\n7. T132: Run goreleaser check. Tool not installed \u2014 install (go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest) and run.\n\nALSO: All 132 tasks in tasks.md are still marked [ ] unchecked. Mark completed tasks as [x].\n\nNOTE TO ORCHESTRATOR: The implementer is hitting 'Prompt is too long' errors. The remaining tasks are all small verification/polish tasks. Consider: (1) reducing the implementation prompt drastically \u2014 remove tasks file content, spec content, include ONLY the specific T-number instructions, (2) breaking remaining work into a smaller focused prompt with just the 7 remaining task descriptions.", "completed_tasks": ["T001", "T002", "T003", "T004", "T005", "T006", "T007", "T008", "T009", "T010", "T011", "T012", "T013", "T014", "T015", "T016", "T017", "T018", "T019", "T020", "T021", "T022", "T023", "T024", "T025", "T026", "T027", "T028", "T029", "T030", "T031", "T032", "T033", "T034", "T035", "T036", "T037", "T038", "T039", "T040", "T041", "T042", "T043", "T044", "T045", "T046", "T047", "T048", "T049", "T050", "T051", "T052", "T053", "T054", "T055", "T056", "T057", "T058", "T059", "T060", "T061", "T062", "T063", "T064", "T065", "T066", "T067", "T068", "T069", "T070", "T071", "T072", "T073", "T074", "T075", "T076", "T077", "T078", "T079", "T080", "T082", "T083", "T084", "T085", "T086", "T087", "T088", "T089", "T090", "T091", "T092", "T093", "T094", "T095", "T096", "T097", "T098", "T099", "T100", "T101", "T102", "T103", "T104", "T105", "T106", "T107", "T108", "T109", "T110", "T111", "T112", "T113", "T114", "T115", "T116", "T117", "T118", "T119", "T120", "T121", "T122", "T123", "T124", "T130", "T131"], "incomplete_tasks": ["T081", "T125", "T126", "T127", "T128", "T129", "T132"], "inadmissible_practices": []}}
