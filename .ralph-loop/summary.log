[2026-01-30T17:23:31-03:00] ESCALATED: STUCK IN LOOP: 2 consecutive iterations (2 and 3) failed with 'Prompt is too long' — zero code changes since iteration 1. The implementation prompt exceeds the context window and cannot execute. The previous validator already flagged this with a note to the orchestrator to reduce prompt size, but no action was taken.

The loop cannot self-recover. The orchestrator must intervene by either:
1. Drastically reducing the implementation prompt (remove tasks file content, remove spec content, include ONLY the T078 fix instructions)
2. Breaking the remaining work into a separate smaller task

Remaining fixes needed (all small):
- T078: In cmd/ralph-loop/main.go runOrchestrator(), add ~20 lines after line 184 to call model.SetupCrossValidation/SetupFinalPlanValidation/SetupTasksValidation and create CrossRunner + TasksValRunner
- T125: Install and run golangci-lint
- T126-T128: Run parity diffs and record evidence
- T132: Install and run goreleaser check (1h 27m 14s)

[2026-01-30T20:41:56-03:00] Iteration 13: Verdict = ESCALATE
[2026-01-30T20:41:56-03:00] ESCALATED: ITERATION 13 PRODUCED ZERO OUTPUT. The implementer hit 'Prompt is too long' (0 tokens processed, 774ms). This is the 6th+ consecutive iteration where the implementer failed to execute due to context window overflow. The loop CANNOT self-recover — the orchestrator's prompt is too large for the AI to even begin processing.

STATUS OF REMAINING WORK:
The prior validator (iteration 12) identified 7 incomplete tasks. Since iteration 13 did ZERO work, ALL 7 remain incomplete:

1. T081: Help text test uses assert.Contains (substring match) instead of character-for-character comparison. Task requires golden file comparison.

2. T125: golangci-lint is NOT INSTALLED on this machine. Task cannot be completed without installation: `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest`

3. T126: Help text parity FAILS. Go binary uses sectioned format (USAGE/FLAGS/EXIT CODES/EXAMPLES). Shell uses flat 'Options:' list with additional sections (Timeout Configuration, Cross-Validation, Original Plan Validation, Configuration Files, etc.). These are NOT character-for-character matches — not even close.

4. T127: State file parity verification never performed. No evidence exists.

5. T128: CRITICAL — Prompt templates are MASSIVELY TRUNCATED:
   - cross-validation.txt: 22 lines vs shell's 160 lines (86% missing)
   - tasks-validation.txt: 15 lines vs shell's 122 lines (88% missing)
   - final-plan.txt: 20 lines vs shell's 60 lines (67% missing)
   - validation.txt: 158 lines vs shell's 170 lines (7% missing, closest match)
   Tasks T062/T107 say 'copy verbatim text' — these are NOT verbatim copies.

6. T129: Exit code parity verification never performed. No evidence.

7. T132: goreleaser is NOT INSTALLED on this machine. Task cannot be completed without installation.

ADDITIONAL ISSUES:
- ALL 132 tasks in tasks.md remain marked [ ] — zero marked as [x]
- --version flag is advertised in help text but returns 'unknown flag: --version' (only subcommand works)
- coverage.out was never generated (T130 partially incomplete)

WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED (125/132 tasks):
- All 18 internal packages exist with both source and test files (96 Go files total)
- All tests pass with -race detection (18 packages, 0 failures)
- Cross-compilation succeeds for all 3 platforms (darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, linux/amd64)
- Full project structure: cmd/, internal/, testdata/, .github/workflows/, Makefile, .golangci.yml, .goreleaser.yml

ESCALATION REASON: The implementation loop has been stuck for 6+ iterations on 'Prompt is too long'. The remaining 7 tasks are all achievable but require the orchestrator to DRASTICALLY reduce prompt size (remove full spec, plan, and tasks.md content — include ONLY the 7 remaining task descriptions) OR break these into a separate smaller session. The current approach will never converge. (4h 45m 39s)
