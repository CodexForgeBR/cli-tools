However, the CRITICAL issue is that tasks.md has ZERO tasks checked off (0 out of 132). The implementer must update tasks.md to mark completed tasks with [x]. Without this, the orchestrator cannot track progress, which is why the loop reached iteration 7 and hit 'Prompt is too long'. The implementer MUST: (1) Check off all completed tasks in specs/001-ralph-loop-go-cli/tasks.md by changing '- [ ]' to '- [x]' for every task that has been implemented and verified. This is the ONLY remaining work. All code is written and tested.", "completed_tasks": [], "incomplete_tasks": ["T001-T132: All tasks are unchecked in tasks.md despite code being written and tests passing.
