I'll start by reading both files to perform the validation.
[Tool Call: Glob] {"pattern": "**/*.md", "path": "/Users/bccs/source/cli-tools"}
[Tool Call: Read] {"file_path": "/Users/bccs/source/cli-tools/specs/001-ralph-loop-go-cli/spec.md"}
[Tool Call: Read] {"file_path": "/Users/bccs/source/cli-tools/specs/001-ralph-loop-go-cli/tasks.md"}
Now let me also read the supporting design documents to understand the full spec context.
[Tool Call: Read] {"file_path": "/Users/bccs/source/cli-tools/specs/001-ralph-loop-go-cli/plan.md"}
[Tool Call: Read] {"file_path": "/Users/bccs/source/cli-tools/specs/001-ralph-loop-go-cli/data-model.md"}
[Tool Call: Read] {"file_path": "/Users/bccs/source/cli-tools/specs/001-ralph-loop-go-cli/contracts/cli-interface.md"}
I've now read both the spec and tasks files, plus the supporting design documents (plan, data model, CLI interface contract). Let me perform a thorough validation.

### Edge Cases Covered

- AI CLI not installed: T047, T070
- tasks.md not found: T014, T026
- AI process hang: T045, T068
- No parseable JSON output: T046, T069
- Config file syntax errors: T013 (comments, whitespace, empty lines)
- No interrupted session on --resume: T087

- --start-at past time: T120, T122
- State directory permissions: covered by state manager init
- --clean + --resume precedence: T089, T092

### Scheduling (User Story 8)

The spec mentions scheduling in User Story 2 (flag `--start-at`), the edge cases section, and FR-013 (phase 9: schedule wait). The tasks file correctly includes Phase 10 (T120-T124) covering schedule parsing, waiting, and orchestrator integration. Note: while the spec doesn't have a dedicated User Story for scheduling, the tasks correctly extracted this from the flag definitions and the 10-phase workflow.

### Scope Control

No tasks add features beyond the spec. The tasks strictly implement what the spec requires. Phase 11 (Polish) appropriately focuses on parity verification rather than adding new features.
