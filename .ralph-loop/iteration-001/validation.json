{"RALPH_VALIDATION": {"verdict": "NEEDS_MORE_WORK", "feedback": "Solid implementation: all 18 packages compile, 969 test runs pass with race detection, cross-compilation works for all 3 platforms. However, T078 wiring is incomplete: main.go does not create or assign CrossRunner or TasksValRunner on the orchestrator. The model.SetupCrossValidation(), model.SetupFinalPlanValidation(), and model.SetupTasksValidation() functions are implemented but never called. This means cross-validation (US5) and tasks validation (US5) will never execute in the real binary. Fix: In cmd/ralph-loop/main.go runOrchestrator(), after creating impl/val runners, call model.SetupCrossValidation() and model.SetupTasksValidation(), then create and assign orch.CrossRunner and orch.TasksValRunner using the resolved AI/model values. Also, T125 (golangci-lint) and T132 (goreleaser check) were not actually run \u2014 the implementer admitted these tools are not installed. Consider installing them or documenting the gap.
