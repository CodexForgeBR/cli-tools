{"RALPH_VALIDATION": {"verdict": "ESCALATE", "feedback": "ITERATION 13 PRODUCED ZERO OUTPUT. The implementer hit 'Prompt is too long' (0 tokens processed, 774ms). This is the 6th+ consecutive iteration where the implementer failed to execute due to context window overflow. The loop CANNOT self-recover \u2014 the orchestrator's prompt is too large for the AI to even begin processing.\n\nSTATUS OF REMAINING WORK:\nThe prior validator (iteration 12) identified 7 incomplete tasks. Since iteration 13 did ZERO work, ALL 7 remain incomplete:\n\n1. T081: Help text test uses assert.Contains (substring match) instead of character-for-character comparison. Task requires golden file comparison.\n\n2. T125: golangci-lint is NOT INSTALLED on this machine. Task cannot be completed without installation: `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest`\n\n3. T126: Help text parity FAILS. Go binary uses sectioned format (USAGE/FLAGS/EXIT CODES/EXAMPLES). Shell uses flat 'Options:' list with additional sections (Timeout Configuration, Cross-Validation, Original Plan Validation, Configuration Files, etc.). These are NOT character-for-character matches \u2014 not even close.\n\n4. T127: State file parity verification never performed. No evidence exists.\n\n5. T128: CRITICAL \u2014 Prompt templates are MASSIVELY TRUNCATED:\n   - cross-validation.txt: 22 lines vs shell's 160 lines (86% missing)\n   - tasks-validation.txt: 15 lines vs shell's 122 lines (88% missing)\n   - final-plan.txt: 20 lines vs shell's 60 lines (67% missing)\n   - validation.txt: 158 lines vs shell's 170 lines (7% missing, closest match)\n   Tasks T062/T107 say 'copy verbatim text' \u2014 these are NOT verbatim copies.\n\n6. T129: Exit code parity verification never performed. No evidence.\n\n7. T132: goreleaser is NOT INSTALLED on this machine. Task cannot be completed without installation.\n\nADDITIONAL ISSUES:\n- ALL 132 tasks in tasks.md remain marked [ ] \u2014 zero marked as [x]\n- --version flag is advertised in help text but returns 'unknown flag: --version' (only subcommand works)\n- coverage.out was never generated (T130 partially incomplete)\n\nWHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED (125/132 tasks):\n- All 18 internal packages exist with both source and test files (96 Go files total)\n- All tests pass with -race detection (18 packages, 0 failures)\n- Cross-compilation succeeds for all 3 platforms (darwin/arm64, darwin/amd64, linux/amd64)\n- Full project structure: cmd/, internal/, testdata/, .github/workflows/, Makefile, .golangci.yml, .goreleaser.yml\n\nESCALATION REASON: The implementation loop has been stuck for 6+ iterations on 'Prompt is too long'. The remaining 7 tasks are all achievable but require the orchestrator to DRASTICALLY reduce prompt size (remove full spec, plan, and tasks.md content \u2014 include ONLY the 7 remaining task descriptions) OR break these into a separate smaller session.
