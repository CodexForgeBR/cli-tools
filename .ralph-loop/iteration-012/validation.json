{"RALPH_VALIDATION": {"verdict": "NEEDS_MORE_WORK", "feedback": "Iteration 12 produced ZERO output (impl-output-12.txt is 0 bytes). The implementer hit 'Prompt is too long' and did no work this iteration. However, prior iterations (1-11) built substantial infrastructure \u2014 all 18 packages compile, all tests pass including with -race, cross-compilation succeeds for all 3 platforms. The REMAINING 7 incomplete tasks are small but real:\n\n1. T081: Help text test requires CHARACTER-FOR-CHARACTER comparison against shell --help output. Current test (usage_test.go) only uses assert.Contains for substring presence. This is insufficient \u2014 the task says 'compare character-for-character against shell version's help text'. Fix: capture shell help output as golden file, compare exact match.\n\n2. T125: golangci-lint is NOT INSTALLED. Task says 'Run golangci-lint and fix all lint issues'. Cannot verify without running it. Install with `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest` then run and fix issues.\n\n3. T126: Help text parity diff was never performed. Go binary help and shell help are DIFFERENT formats \u2014 Go uses custom template with sections (USAGE/FLAGS/EXIT CODES/EXAMPLES), shell uses flat Options list. Not character-for-character match. Must diff and reconcile.\n\n4. T127: State file parity verification never done. Task says 'create a state file with the shell version, load it with the Go binary, save it back, and diff'. No evidence this was performed.\n\n5. T128: CRITICAL \u2014 Prompt templates are MASSIVELY TRUNCATED:\n   - cross-validation.txt: 22 lines vs shell's 160 lines (86% missing). Missing: detailed inadmissible checks, non-existent functionality detection steps, output format JSON schema, verdict meanings.\n   - tasks-validation.txt: 15 lines vs shell's 122 lines (88% missing). Missing: validation rules, common issues to catch, task quality standards, output format JSON schema.\n   - final-plan.txt: 20 lines vs shell's 60 lines (67% missing). Missing: detailed validation rules, output format.\n   - validation.txt: 158 lines vs shell's 170 lines (close but needs diff).\n   Task T062/T107 says 'copy verbatim text' \u2014 these are NOT verbatim copies.\n\n6. T129: Exit code parity verification never done. No evidence each exit condition (0-6, 130) was tested against shell version.\n\n7. T132: goreleaser is NOT INSTALLED. Cannot run `goreleaser check`. Install with `go install github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/v2@latest`.\n\nADDITIONAL ISSUE: T130 requires coverage output file (coverage.out) \u2014 it was never generated. Run `go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`.\n\nADDITIONAL ISSUE: ALL 132 tasks in tasks.md are still marked [ ] unchecked. Mark completed tasks as [x].\n\nADDITIONAL ISSUE: --version flag in help text but doesn't work as a flag (only as subcommand `ralph-loop version`). T114 and help text advertise `--version` flag.\n\nNOTE TO ORCHESTRATOR: The implementer has been stuck on 'Prompt is too long' for 6+ consecutive iterations. The remaining tasks are small verification/polish tasks. The prompt MUST be drastically reduced \u2014 include ONLY the specific task descriptions for the 7 remaining tasks.
