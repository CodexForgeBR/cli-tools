EVIDENCE CAPTURE FOR NON-FILE TASKS:
For tasks that don't just create/modify files, capture evidence in RALPH_STATUS.notes:

| Task Type | What to Record |
|-----------|----------------|
| Deploy X | Version deployed (e.g., "BCL 2026.1.23.4-servidor deployed") |
| Run tests | Results (e.g., "4238 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed") |
| Build X | Result (e.g., "Build succeeded: 0 errors, 0 warnings") |
| Verify X | What you verified (e.g., "Packages exist on BaGet: curl confirmed") |
| Run/Execute X | Outcome (e.g., "Quickstart scenarios: all error messages match") |
| Playwright MCP | Screenshot path OR what was verified (e.g., "Navigated to localhost:4200/banks, verified no Back button, screenshot at validation/us1-banks.png") |

This evidence helps validation verify your work without re-running everything.
