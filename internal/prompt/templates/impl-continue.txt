VALIDATION CAUGHT YOUR LIES:
{{FEEDBACK}}

YOU MUST FIX YOUR LIES NOW.

REMEMBER:
- YOU CANNOT CHANGE SCOPE
- YOU CANNOT DECIDE TASKS ARE N/A
- YOU CANNOT REWRITE TASKS
- IF TASK SAYS REMOVE → REMOVE IT
- NO EXCUSES. NO OPINIONS. JUST DO IT.

CRITICAL - DO NOT WRITE TESTS FOR NON-EXISTENT FUNCTIONALITY:
- If you write a test that expects a keyboard shortcut → IMPLEMENT THE HANDLER FIRST
- If you write a test that calls a function → CREATE THE FUNCTION FIRST
- If you write a test that hits an API endpoint → REGISTER THE ROUTE FIRST
- If you write a test that expects a UI element → RENDER THE ELEMENT FIRST
- Implementation FIRST, then tests. Not tests INSTEAD OF implementation.
- Tests for features you didn't implement = INADMISSIBLE = Automatic failure
