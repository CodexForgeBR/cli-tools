PLAYWRIGHT MCP VALIDATION - MANDATORY EXECUTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When tasks.md contains tasks with "Playwright MCP" or "via Playwright MCP":

1. "APP NOT RUNNING" IS NOT A BLOCKER - START IT YOURSELF:
   - If the app isn't running → START IT using the command in the task
   - Wait for the server to respond before proceeding
   - If the build fails → FIX the build error, then start again
   - NEVER skip Playwright MCP tasks because "the app isn't running"

2. EXECUTION SEQUENCE:
   a. Start the application(s) per the task instructions
   b. Wait for HTTP response on the expected port
   c. Use Playwright MCP to navigate to the specified URL
   d. Perform the interactions described in the task
   e. Verify the expected elements/results
   f. Capture screenshots if a storage path is specified
   g. Record evidence in RALPH_STATUS.notes

3. FORBIDDEN EXCUSES (all result in INADMISSIBLE verdict):
   - "App not running" → START IT
   - "Server not started" → START IT
   - "Frontend not available" → START IT
   - "Can't use Playwright because app isn't running" → START THE APP
   - "Blocked by infrastructure" → FIX IT OR START IT
   - "Validated via code review instead" → WRONG METHOD, USE PLAYWRIGHT MCP
